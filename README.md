# School Assigments
This is a repository dedicated for examples that I have done for school assignments showcasing my skills in Python.

I have several assignments that showcase what I have done in Python.

The following projects include:

* Feet to Inches Converter: Converts feet that a user inputs to the amount of inches. (ft-in.py)
* Prime Number Testing Program: A user enters in a number to determine if the number is a prime number or not. (prime-number-test.py)
* Grade Average Calculator: Calculates the averages based on the grades that a user enters in. (grade-average.py)
* Bookstore: A user will initially be prompted to login or register depending on their account status. Next, when a user creates their account they will be shown the main menu which asks them to add, delete, find, or sell a book. Each function they go through will allow them to add, delete, find, or sell a book as they please. Finally, once they are done with their specific use they can continue to perform other funcitonality or log out. (bookstore.py)
